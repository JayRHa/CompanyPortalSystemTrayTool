A few weeks ago I released the Company Portal System Tray tool. The posts have a very good feedback and the tool was tested by some and also used productively. I have been working on developing the tool further and integrating more useful functions that can help with troubleshooting. The first version of the Company Portal system tray icon has many quick access possibilities to system tools or logs that are important for troubleshooting an Intune managed device. In addition, this tool has a quick access to open the Company Portal.

In this blog I want to introduce the new version of the Tool.
